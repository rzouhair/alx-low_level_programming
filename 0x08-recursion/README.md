1. **File 0-puts_recursion.c** - This file includes a function that prints a given string followed by a new line using recursion.

2. **File 1-print_rev_recursion.c** - Within this file, there is a function that prints a given string in reverse using recursion.

3. **File 2-strlen_recursion.c** - This file holds a function that calculates and returns the length of a given string using recursion.

4. **File 3-factorial.c** - Contained in this file is a function that computes and returns the factorial of a given number using recursion.

5. **File 4-pow_recursion.c** - This file contains a function that calculates and returns the value of 'x' raised to the power of 'y' using recursion.

6. **File 5-sqrt_recursion.c** - Inside this file, you can find a function that returns the natural square root of a given number using recursion.

7. **File 6-is_prime_number.c** - Within this file, a function is implemented that determines if a given integer is a prime number or not. It returns 1 if the number is prime, otherwise, it returns 0.

8. **File 100-is_palindrome.c** - This file contains a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome. The function returns 1 if the string is a palindrome and 0 if it is not.

9. **File 101-wildcmp.c** - Inside this file, there is a function that compares two strings, considering the concept of wildcards. The function returns 1 if the strings are identical with wildcards, otherwise, it returns 0.

10. **File _putchar.c** - This file includes the implementation of the `_putchar` function, used for printing individual characters.

11. **File main.h** - It is the header file that contains the function prototypes for all the functions defined in the above files.
